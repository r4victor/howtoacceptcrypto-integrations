# Overview

This repository is a collection of test integrations made while doing a research for [HowToAcceptCrypto.com](http://HowToAcceptCrypto.com). You can explore these integrations to get a feeling for how different payment processors work before diving into reading a documentation. You can navigate through the examples using our [comparison table](http://HowToAcceptCrypto.com/table) or you can directly to `app/integrations` directory of this repository and see no more than the actual code.
