# Overview

This repository is a collection of test integrations made while doing a research for [HowToAcceptCrypto.com](http://HowToAcceptCrypto.com). Although the primary goal of this work is to get a personal experience with payment processors, you may want to explore these integrations to get an idea for how different solutions work before diving into reading the docs. You can navigate through the examples using our [comparison chart](http://HowToAcceptCrypto.com/chart) or you can go directly to `app/integrations` directory of this repository and see no more than the actual code.
